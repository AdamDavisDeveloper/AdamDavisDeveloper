## Heya, I'm Adam


I'm a software engineer currently living in Atlanta, GA. I work as a web developer at <a href="https://github.com/adamSionic">Sionic Mobile</a> (which is why my personal Github has been so dead ðŸ˜¬).
I like making new friends, creating tech projects, and learning all kinds of new things!
<br/>
Looking to start a collective/community of tech people, web creatives, and artists. Contact me if interested.
